# Inverted-Search
It looks like you have a set of files related to an inverted search project, particularly in the context of data structures. To run this project, you may follow these general steps:

1. **Compilation:**
   - Ensure that you have a suitable compiler installed on your system, like GCC for C projects.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your files.

2. **Makefile:**
   - Check if there is a `makefile` in your project. The `makefile` typically contains instructions on how to compile and build your project.
   - If a `makefile` is present, you can use the `make` command to build the project:

     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. **Compile Individual Files:**
   - If there is no `makefile` or you want to compile individual files, you can use the compiler directly:

     ```bash
     gcc -o output_file source_file.c
     ```

     Replace `output_file` with the desired name for the compiled program and `source_file.c` with the name of the source file you want to compile.

4. **Run the Program:**
   - Once the compilation is successful, you can run the executable:

     ```bash
     ./output_file
     ```

     Replace `output_file` with the name you provided during compilation.

5. **Check the Output:**
   - Depending on the functionality of your program, it may generate output, create databases, or perform searches. Review the program's output or any generated files to see the results.

6. **Adjustments:**
   - If there are dependencies between files, make sure to compile and link them appropriately. For example, if `main.c` is the entry point, it may include other files or headers.

Make sure to read any documentation or comments within the code for specific instructions. If there are errors during compilation, carefully review the error messages to identify and fix any issues.
