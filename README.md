 To run this project, you may follow these general steps:

1. **Compilation:**
   - Ensure that you have a suitable compiler installed on your system, like GCC for C projects.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your files.

2. **Makefile:**
   - Check if there is a `makefile` in your project. The `makefile` typically contains instructions on how to compile and build your project.
   - If a `makefile` is present, you can use the `make` command to build the project:

     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. **Compile Individual Files:**
   - If there is no `makefile` or you want to compile individual files, you can use the compiler directly:

     ```bash
     gcc -o final  main.c createdatabase.c databasehashtableinit.c hash_function.c hashtableinsert.c print_hashtable.c hashtablesearch.c process_word_count.c save_to_database.c
     ```


4. **Run the Program:**
   - Once the compilation is successful, you can run the executable:

     ```bash
     ./final
     ```
